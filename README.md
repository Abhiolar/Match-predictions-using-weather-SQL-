## PROJECT DEFINITION
This project is focused on calculating the winning ratio of football teams in the bundesliga when it was raining and whether the weather affected the team's performance over the course of the 2011 season. The database was accessed using SQL. and the weather data was parsed through using DARKSKY API.


## REUSULTS
Bayern Munich has the highest winning in percentage with 72.73% followed closely in second by Borrusia Dortumund. The team that performs worst in the rain turned out to be Kaiserslautern with 0% winning percentage in the rain but bear in mind other factors can attribute to a team's winning's percentage/loss over the course of a season. But we were only looking at the performances of the team for the scope of this project.
